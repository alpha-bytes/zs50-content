ZS50 is a companion resource to the immensely popular online course *CS50* from [Harvard EDX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x), after which it is shamelessly named. This course is for developers and would-be-developers looking to sharpen their skills in general and, specifically, on the Salesforce platform. 

The "z" stands for [Zinovo](https://www.zinovo.com/). The "s" is up to you (science? Salesforce? sardines?). We just wanted it to rhyme. 

### Why not just take CS50
Where CS50 guides students through the intellectual art of programming using popular general-purpose languages like `C` and `Python`, ZS50 adapts that course's content and weekly challenges around Salesforce's proprietary `Apex` language. Challenges also incorporate other important features of the Salesforce runtime, including `SOQL` (SQL-*ish* query language), `Javascript` (used client-side in Lightning), and anything else we happen to think is pertinent to the weekly discussions. 

### Format
For each weekly lecture in CS50 there is a corresponding `week[n]` in the [lectures](lectures/list.md) sub-folder with Salesforce-specific content and discussions. 

Similarly, the [psets](psets/list.md) folder contains weekly programming challenges which have been translated for use on the Salesforce platform. 

### Course Goals
As a companion resource to `CS50` this course seeks - in addition to the goals of the original course - to help you: 

1. Deductively apply foundational CS principles to Salesforce development, 
2. Introduce and explore higher-order concepts including `object oriented programming`, `inheritance`, and `abstraction`, among others, in an approachable and practicable manner, and
3. Ultimately, and most importantly, to **deepen your knowledge of the intellectual art of programming, and it's specific Salesforce permutations, in order to help you become a more confident and robust problem solver**. 

### Ok I'm convinced (piqued, at least) - now what?
Getting started with ZS50 is easy and completely free. 

1. Sign up for a free [Github account](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one already. You'll need this in order to access the browser-based environment for completing the weekly Apex challenges (see *step 4* below). 
2. Watch the weekly CS50 lecture (beginning with `week 0`, not week 1). You can find these on the [CS50 Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcabW7890RKJzL968QWEykA) or by registering for the (again, free) course at [EDX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). 
> Aside: While you don't need to register for CS50 to take *ZS50*, it's a nice way to get access to the lectures, notes, video shorts, and `C` problem sets organized by week. If you're an extra-credit type of person, you could also complete the CS50 psets to compare / contrast how to solve the same types of problems in Apex. Onward...
3. Review the Salesforce-specific [lecture notes](./lectures/list.md) for the week
4. Complete the weekly Apex challenges located in the [psets](./psets/list.md) folder. For this you can use a ready-to-run
**CS50 Sandbox** configured specifically for completing the challenges. Setup is as simple as clicking a link but there are a few things to note about the sandbox environments. [Click here](./setup/sandbox.md) for the details. 
5. Completion of the challenges requires typing some basic commands into the provided terminal window using the `zs50` command line utility, whose documentation lives [here](https://github.com/alpha-bytes/zs50). 

You can also complete the challenges on your local machine, but it requires a bit more setup. 

### Happy Trails
Some parting thoughts before you embark: 
- Like it's namesake, ZS50 will continue evolving. Expect change and you won't be disappointed. 
- As CS50's professor is fond of saying, where you end up relative to others at the end of this course doesn't much matter. It's where you end up relative to *yourself* that counts.
