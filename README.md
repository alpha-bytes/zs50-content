## This is `ZS50`
ZS50 is a companion resource to the immensely popular online course *CS50* from [Harvard EDX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x), after which it is shamelessly named. This course is for developers and would-be-developers looking to sharpen their skills in general and, specifically, on the Salesforce platform. 

The "z" stands for [Zinovo](https://www.zinovo.com/). The "s" is up to you (science? Salesforce? sardines?). We just wanted it to rhyme. 

### Why not just take CS50
Where CS50 guides students through the intellectual art of programming using popular general-purpose languages like `C` and `Python`, ZS50 adapts that course's content and weekly challenges around Salesforce's proprietary `Apex` language. Challenges also incorporate other important features of the Salesforce runtime, including `SOQL` (SQL-*ish* query language), `Javascript` (used client-side in Lightning), and anything else we happen to think is pertinent to the weekly discussions. 

### Format
For each weekly lecture in CS50 there is a corresponding `week[n]` in the [lectures](lectures/list.md) sub-folder with Salesforce-specific content and discussions. You can also access these in a prettier format over at https://alpha-bytes.github.io/zs50-content. 

Similarly, the [psets](psets/list.md) folder contains weekly programming challenges which have been translated for use on the Salesforce platform. 

### Course Goals
TODO

### Ok I'm convinced (sort of)...now what?
1. Sign up for a free [Github account](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one already.
2. Watch the weekly CS50 lecture (beginning with `week 0`, not week 1)
3. Review the Salesforce-specific [lecture notes](./lectures/list.md) for the week
4. Complete the weekly Apex challenges located in the [psets](./psets/list.md) folder. For this you can use a ready-to-run
[CS50 Sandbox](https://sandbox.cs50.io/?name=ZS50_0.2&script=mkdir%20classes%20%26%26%20npm%20i%20git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Falpha-bytes%2Fzs50.git%20%26%26%20npm%20link%20.%2Fnode_modules%2Fzs50&window=editor&window=terminal) configured specifically for completing the challenges. 

You can also complete the challenges on your local machine, but it requires a bit more setup (TODO). 

### Happy Trails
A few parting thoughts before you embark: 
- Like it's namesake, ZS50 will continue evolving. Expect change and you won't be disappointed. 
- As David is fond of saying, where you end up relative to others at the end of this course doesn't much matter. It's where you end up relative to *yourself* that counts.
