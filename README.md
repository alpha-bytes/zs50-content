## This is `ZS50`
ZS50 is a companion resource to the immensely popular online course *CS50* from [Harvard EDX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x), after which it is shamelessly named. This course is for developers and would-be-developers looking to sharpen their skills in general and, specifically, on the Salesforce platform. 

The "z" stands for [Zinovo](https://www.zinovo.com/). The "s" is up to you (science? Salesforce? sardines?). We just wanted it to rhyme. 

### Why not just take CS50
Where CS50 guides students through the intellectual art of programming using popular general-purpose languages like `C` and `Python`, ZS50 adapts that course's content and weekly challenges around Salesforce's proprietary `Apex` language. Challenges also incorporate other important features of the Salesforce runtime, including `SOQL` (SQL-*ish* query language), `Javascript` (used client-side in Lightning), and anything else we happen to think is pertinent to the weekly discussions. 

### Format
For each weekly lecture in CS50 there is a corresponding `week[n]` in the [lectures](lectures/list.md) sub-folder with Salesforce-specific content and discussions. You can also access these in a prettier format over at https://alpha-bytes.github.io/zs50-content. 

Similarly, the [psets](psets/list.md) folder contains weekly programming challenges which have been translated for use on the Salesforce platform. 

### Course Goals
Above and beyond the goals of *CS50* itself, we hope you'll achieve: 
- Hands-on experience with developer tools including: 
    - `VS Code` (IDE) and relevant Salesforce extensions
    - `SFDX` command-line-interface (CLI)

### Ok I'm convinced (sort of)...now what? 

### Happy Trails
A few parting thoughts before you embark: 
- Like it's namesake, ZS50 will continue evolving. Expect change and you won't be disappointed. 
- As David is fond of saying, where you end up relative to others at the end of this course doesn't much matter. It's where you end up relative to *yourself* that counts.
