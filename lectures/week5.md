### Asynchronous Execution

- cs50 doesn't go into detail, but much of JS executes `asynchronously` (or at least has the effect of such via event loop)
    - debugging example with code
- Apex, generally, executes `synchronously`
    - certain cases where async execution makes more sense
    - tools to do so `batch`, `scheduled`, `queueable` [matrix]
