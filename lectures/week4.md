#### Array and Linked List
In Apex, don't need to declare any collection (array, List, Set, Map) size in advance. All dynamically add memory as necessary. 

#### Structs vs. Classes

#### Hashes
What is a hash or, more appropriately, a `hash function`? Anything that can map data of an arbitrary length (x) to data of a fixed length (y), such that any unique input *x* results in a unique output *y*.

Where used in SF? Think implementation of `sosl`.

- Indexed fields in SF
- How can we implement own hash table in SF? 
    - `Map<Object, List<Object>>`
