### ZS50 Week 1: Apex
In week 1 of CS50 we were introduced to `C`, a low-level general purpose programming language. Salesforce's proprietary `Apex` programming language, though *not* general purpose (it only compiles and runs on Salesforce servers), expresses many syntactical and idiomatic similarities. Apex's closest general purpose cousin is `Java`, an object-oriented language built in many ways as a successor to earlier languages like C and C++, so it makes sense that many of the early paradigms have persisted. You will find this reuse and resilience of legacy paradigms to be a common feature of programming languages, generally, should you decide to explore others. This is great for us as developers as it lessens the learning curve when moving from one language to the next!
