## ZS50 Week 2

CS50 week6 covered Python, a widely used programming language that has grown in popularity in recent years. While it's a great general purpose programming language to have in your toolbelt as a developer, there's not much here in the way of new *fundamentals* or *paradigms* that we need to translate to Apex. 

So, rather than jamming a üî≤ peg in a ‚ö™Ô∏è hole, we'll take a complete ninety degree turn this week and cover something much more applicable to Salesforce dev: `Salesforce Developer Tools`.
